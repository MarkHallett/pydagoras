* Document the [pypi pydagoras package](package.md) that underpins the demo site.
* Show an example script that uses `pydagoras`.
* Document the  [demo site](https://pydagoras.com) where example DAGs can be seen and used.

## [Package](package.md)
pydagoras can be installed from PyPi, which can be reached using the Python link the bottom right corner of this page.</br>
The package section details;

* What is included in the package
* Other ways to get pydagoras

## [Example use](example_script.md)
in index.md

## [Example use](example_app.md)
This section details an example of a front end, that connects to a backend pydagoras DAG, and shows the DAG graphicaly as it updates.

* How to constuct a DAG using pydagoras by creating and linking nodes
* Updating inputs
* Accessing the output

## [Demo](demo.md)
This section links to the demo site, it details how to use the demo site and to make and see changes to the DAGs.
It also shows shows screenshots of example DAGs, as well as a video site showing three example pydagoras DAGs being updated.


## [Code reference](reference.md)
