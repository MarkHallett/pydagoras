* Accessing the output

## [Example use](example_use.md)
This section show an example of a backend pydagoras DAG connecting to a front end to show the DAG graphicaly as it updates.


## [Demo](demo.md)

Later this will link to a hosted site that allows users to enter values and see the DAGs update.

## [Code reference](reference.md)
